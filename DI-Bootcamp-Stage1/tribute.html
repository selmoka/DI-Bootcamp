					<p class="text-biography">
						Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. His early education was characterized by a curiosity about nature and an ability to grasp complex mathematical concepts. At the age of 16, he wrote his first scientific paper, "The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields," reflecting his interest in the workings of the universe. Despite his intellectual capabilities, Einstein's nonconformity and rebellious nature led to challenges in the traditional education system, culminating in his failure to secure a teaching position immediately after graduation. However, he persevered, and in 1905, while working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, he published four groundbreaking papers in the "Annalen der Physik" that would alter the course of physics. This year became known as his Annus Mirabilis, or "miracle year."
					</p>
					<p class="text-biography">
						Einstein's most famous work during his Annus Mirabilis included the theory of special relativity, encapsulated in the equation E=mc², which describes the relationship between mass and energy. This revolutionary concept laid the groundwork for modern physics and fundamentally changed our understanding of time and space. In subsequent years, Einstein expanded his theories, developing the general theory of relativity, which provided a new description of gravity as a curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy. His predictions, such as the bending of light by gravity, were confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919, catapulting him to international fame. In 1921, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which further validated quantum theory.
					</p>
					<p class="text-biography">
						Beyond his scientific contributions, Einstein was an outspoken advocate for civil rights and a committed pacifist, using his platform to speak out against militarism and nationalism. In 1933, facing the rise of the Nazi regime, he emigrated to the United States, accepting a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. There, he continued his work on unified field theory, attempting to reconcile the forces of nature into a single framework. Einstein remained in Princeton until his death on April 18, 1955. His legacy endures not only through his profound scientific insights but also through his humanitarian efforts and his enduring curiosity about the universe.
